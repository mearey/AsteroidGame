text = "In a faraway future... \n\n\n The year is 202X A2C (After the Second Coming of Christ AKA AI Jesus). The WORLDWIDE WAREHOUSE COMPANY (WWWC) that ruled the Earth for decades has been dismantled by a group of brave REBELS. \n\nThese brave heroes of Earth vowed to guide mankind in a new direction - a direction of HOPE. \n\nIn an act of defiance, the Rebels seized and discarded all remaining WWWC assets into the Earth's orbit. \n\nThe Earth is now an impenetrable FORTRESS, surrounded by the crumbling technological legacy of an age gone by. \n\nThis story is not about that. \n\n\nThis story is about a former-WWWC Uber Feeds Delivery Driver. \n\nHis name...\n\nPLEYA ZENO.\n\nIt is the one-year anniversary of the GREAT WWWC CLEANSING. In the midst of the celebrations, Pleya was able to steal a spaceship from the authorities as a 25th birthday present to himself. With it, he seeks to explore the edges of the Solar System and BEYOND. \n\nHe does not know what he is searching for. \n\nThis LONGING he feels is a new sentiment. An ember, a faint glow, struggling to stay alight in the depths of his soul. \n\nDonning his now deemed-illegal WWWC Uber Feeds uniform for one last time, Pleya will finally cash in his unpaid annual leave, attempting to escape the Earth's vengeful grip, and be absorbed by the murky skies above.
